# IBM SkillsBuild 4-Week Internship on AI & Cloud Technologies
This repository documents the capstone project completed during the IBM SkillsBuild 4-Weeks Internship on AI & Cloud Technologies. This program is a collaborative initiative by the Edunet Foundation, AICTE, and IBM SkillsBuild.

The internship's primary goal is to provide hands-on experience in emerging technologies, enhancing employability and confidence by solving real-world challenges using the IBM SkillsBuild and IBM Cloud platforms.

#  Intern Details
- **Name:** MAHESH KANDUKURI
- **Institute:** KL UNIVERSITY
- **Duration:** 4 Weeks (15th July 2025 to 7th August 2025)

# About the internship
This 4-week program focused on providing practical skills in AI and Cloud Computing. The internship was structured with weekly virtual sessions, mentor guidance, and hands-on labs. The curriculum included:

Week 1: Internship Orientation, IBM Cloud Registration, Artificial Intelligence.
Week 2: Data Analytics concepts, Hands-On Labs, and Cloud EDA.
Week 3 & 4: Building a Chat Bot, AI/ML experiments on the cloud, and a deep dive into AutoAI experiments on IBM Cloud.

Successful completion required active participation, completion of at least two courses on IBM SkillsBuild, and the submission of a final project presentation. This internship was offered with no stipend.


# Power System Fault Detection and Classification

## Problem Statement

Design a machine learning model to detect and classify different types of faults in a power 
distribution system. Using electrical measurement data (e.g., voltage and current 
phasors), the model should be able to distinguish between normal operating conditions 
and various fault conditions (such as line-to-ground, line-to-line, or three-phase faults). 
The objective is to enable rapid and accurate fault identification, which is crucial for 
maintaining power grid stability and reliability.

## Dataset

The dataset contains time-series or tabular records of voltage and current phasors, labeled according to the type of fault or normal condition.

Note: Dataset used in this project is either synthetic/simulated or obtained from a public source.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
- Flask 
- IBM Cloud 

## ML Model

The model follows these steps:

1. Preprocessing – Handling missing values, normalization.
2. Feature Engineering – Extract statistical features from phasors.
3. Model Training – Using Decision Tree / Random Forest / SVM.
4. Evaluation – Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision-Recall.

Achieved an accuracy of approximately X% in fault classification.
